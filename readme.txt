Brief Explanation of additional files:

'Machine Learning Project Work File' - this is an html download of the jupyter notebook where 
					I did most of the data exploration, transformation, 
					and created my new feature using pandas mostly.

'ml exploration' - this is an html download of the jupyter notebook where I did my machine
		   learning explorations (testing different algorithms, etc). 

After I was satisfied with my results, I transferred the relevant code to my poi_id.py file.	 

'Exploring Enron Corpus with Machine Learning' - this is an html download of the jupyter note
						 notebook where I answered the project questions.
