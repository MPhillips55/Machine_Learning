# Machine_Learning

This project utilized scikit-learn and pandas to examine the Enron Corpus e-mails. 

## Running code locally:
  * Clone the repo
  * poi_id.py can be run using your tool of choice. The .pkl files were generated using the Enron corpus

## Repo Files

  * 'Machine Learning Project Work File' - this is an html download of the jupyter notebook where did most of the data exploration, transformation, and created a new feature using pandas.

  * 'ml exploration' - this is an html download of the jupyter notebook where I did my machine 
learning explorations (testing different algorithms, etc). 

  * 'Exploring Enron Corpus with Machine Learning' - this is an html download of the jupyter note 
notebook where I answered the project questions.
